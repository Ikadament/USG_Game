  - 'A familiar face, a daring feat,

    Hair in the wind, Goombas on their feet,'
  - Bob-ombs startled, the Chain Chomp's rage, A gloomy forest, a thorny stage,
  - Don't look up - no, don't you dare! The bubbles strike with no spare care,
  - 'A prize awaits - but it slips away,

    The finish line is crossed, '
  - ...
  - "But no one\u2019s there to stay."
