  - This plant is a Pilea cavernicola.
  - 'It was discovered in 2010 in caves in southwest China, pretty cool, right? '
  - It can survive with just 0.04 to 2.78% of normal light! Just like league of legends
    players.
  - The fresh and humid climate all year round actually makes it a pretty cozy spot
    for this little guy.
